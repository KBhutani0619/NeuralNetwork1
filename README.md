The project involved building a neural network using PyTorch to classify text data. It used 100-dimensional GloVe embeddings (pre-trained word vectors) to represent words, followed by a simple feedforward architecture with fully connected layers. The goal was to assign categories or labels to text inputs (e.g., positive/negative for sentiment, but the code was generic for any text classification task). The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, and the model was trained to predict labels accurately.
